# PoweFlowNet
Leveraging Message Passing GNNs for High-Quality Power Flow Approximation.


![poweflownet_arch (1)](https://github.com/stavrosgreece/PoweFlowNet/assets/17108978/7ea2b68f-3aca-452c-a82a-b6614c70626f)

PoweFlowNet's distinctiveness, compared to existing PF GNN approaches, lies in its adept utilization of the capabilities from message-passing GNNs and high-order GCNs in a unique arrangement called PoweFlowConv, for handling a trainable masked embedding of the network graph. This innovative approach renders PoweFlowNet remarkably scalable, presenting an effective solution for the PF problem.

### Description

PoweFlowNet transforms the PF into a GNN node-regression problem by representing each bus as a node and each transmission line as an edge while maintaining the network's connectivity.

### Instructions


To train a model run train.py with the desired arguments. For example:
```
python3 train.py --cfg_json ./configs/standard.json\
                --num-epochs 2000\
                --data-dir ./data/
                --batch-size 128\
                --train_loss_fn mse_loss\
                --lr 0.001\
                --case 118v2\
                --model MaskEmbdMultiMPN\
                --save
```

### File Structure
runnable files:
- `train.py` trains the model
- `results.py` plots the results

# Useful Information
First two dimensions out of seven in `edge_features` are `from_node` and `to_node`, and they are indexed from $1$. This is processed in the `PowerFlowData` dataset class. It is reindexed from $0$ and the `from_node` and `to_node` are removed from the `edge_features` tensor.

Raw data format: 
| Number | Description |
| --- | --- |
| N | number of nodes |
| E | number of edges |
| Fn = 9 | number of features per node |
| Fe = 5 | orginally 7, first two dims are `from_node` and `to_node` number of features per edge |
| Fn_out = 8 | number of output features per node |

| Tensor | Dimension |
| --- | --- |
| `Data.x` | (batch_size*N, Fe) |
| `Data.edge_index` | (2, E) |
| `Data.edge_attr` | (E, Fe) |
| `Data.y` | (batch_size*N, Fn) |
